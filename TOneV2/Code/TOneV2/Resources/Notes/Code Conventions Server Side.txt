Caching:
	- Should be applied where needed
	- Get Cached Entities method should return dictionary (key is the obj identifier)
	- Should not expose the dictionary to public
	- Always have a Get Single Entity method that uses the extension method GetRecord
	- Try to always use the Extension methods, FindAllRecords - GetRecord - MapRecords - ToBigResult ...
	- Make sure mappers return single object and not a list

Paging and Sorting:
	- When caching is applied, make sure sorting and filtering are implemented server side
	- Make sure filtering is applied only on original entity and not on Details
	- When caching is not applied, make sure they are implemented in the database
	- When caching is not used, make sure column mapping is defined and once (static)

Controllers:
	- Should not have business code, only UI
	- Pass the filter here as a string and only deserialize it then pass it to Business Layer
	- Try to return IEnumerable where List is not needed

Info, Details, Query and Filters
	- Info used for dropdowns (id and name)
	- Details used for Grids, the class should get the data from other cach objects and not queries to DB
	- Queries from Grids
	- Filters from selectors

General
	- Make sure to check on nulls where needed
	- Entities should not have business logic
