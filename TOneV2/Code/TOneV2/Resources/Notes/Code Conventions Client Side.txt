General:
	- Enums should be used where needed
	- All common dropdowns should be selectors (vr-whs-be-routingproduct-selector in business entities)
	- The good use of filters in selectors (vr-whs-be-routingproduct-selector in business entities)
	- All business directives should be clean of technical code and events (vr-whs-be-routingproduct-selector in business entities)
	- Same exits messages should be clear and right parameters are passed (take an example the SellingNumberPlanEditorController in Business Entities, Insert and Update methods)
	- Pages should have good design (textboxes aligned, suitable width for editors, no white spaces)
	- For labels, use correct english words (no miss-spelling), in addition the word should not be technical for example, Enabled instead of Is Enabled
	- All controls on all pages should be used, if a control is not used remove it
	- Make sure to organize java script methods the same way in all pages as much as you can
	- Try also to have nested functions when needed to make the page readable
	- When you are sending a payload to a directive, do not send it as empty object, send it undefined because the checks inside directives are against undefined
	- Do not use promise deffered unless it is needed, for example when you are waiting a user action to load another directive, no need to create a ready promise deffered for that directive
	- No need to check against api if different than nulls or undefined in case you are dealing with the grid, as all actions now are user actions like search
	- Make sure to decrease dependencies between directives:
		- the case when DW is used
		- the case when the variable the second directive is depending on can be got from the loaded Entity

Editors:
	- Using tabs (Routing Product Editor)
	- Where tabs are used, create a scope modal object and append all variables to this object
	- Validations
	- Loaders on load and Insert and Update

Management Pages:
	- return the promise after search click for the loader to appear
	- put loaders on filter section in case controls are calling server

Grids:
	- Grids should be directives
	- Grids templates should not have vr row or columns
	- Needed menu actions should be called from the module service
	- Make sure call backs are called correctly
	- Try Add, Update and Delete and make sure the items are shown correclty in updated items tab without any errors
	- Make sure of columns sorting (try all clomuns making sure no errors appear in the console)
	- Make sure of header texts and columns types
	- The use of grids drill downs using tabs (check in Common > Country - City, Code Groups betweek FWK and TOne)

Controllers:
	- Should have the name in the correct format (FWK user VR_ModuleName_XX)
	- Should have the title set in the Editor (make sure we are using setTitle method inside loadAllControls)

Api Services (Any example in Business Entities of TOne):
	- Should apply the new convention
	- Should use the Module Config
	- Should have its name in the correct format
	- Use of Get and Post correctly

Module JS Service:
	- Every object in the module should have a separate service
	- Delete should have a confirmation message that shows the correct message (not custom messages)
	- Always pass id and not objects to service methods
